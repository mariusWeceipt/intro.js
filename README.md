# Changes to adapt to Semantic-UI
Added an option to change color of all elements. Colors follow Semantic-UI naming : 

```javascript
introJs().setOption({ 'customColor': 'teal' });
````

Works with all color classes from Semantic UI (teal, blue, pink ; but also primary, secondary, positive, etc...)
